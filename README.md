# Advent of Code 2025

Let's do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) this year!

The parts of each day are saved as separate files, following the convention of `day-[DAY]-part-[PART].zig` (e.g. `day-5-part-2.zig`). There's a few ways to run the different aspects of each problem:

- `zig run day-[DAY]-part-[PART].zig` runs the example case and writes the output to the terminal. The output is not verified against the correct answer.
- `zig test day-[DAY]-part-[PART].zig` tests the real input against the correct answer.
- `zig test main.zig` tests all solutions to date.
